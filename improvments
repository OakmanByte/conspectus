Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as the GitHub token, rather than hardcoding it in the code. This will prevent the token from being exposed if the code is leaked or shared.

Add error handling for the write_all method call, in case there is an error writing to the file.

Add a way to specify the team name and output file path as command-line arguments, rather than hardcoding them in the code.

Add a way to handle pagination of the GitHub API response, in case the number of repos exceeds the limit per page.

Extract the logic of generating the report to a separate function, that way it will be easier to test and make the code more readable.

Use a library such as clap to handle command line arguments, this will make it easier to handle and validate inputs.

Add a way to handle rate limits of the GitHub API, This can be done by checking the headers of the API response to see if the rate limit has been reached.

Use a library such as log to handle logging, so that it will be easier to see what's happening during the execution of the program.

Use a library such as prettytable to generate the table of the report, it will make it more organized and readable.

Use a library such as lazy_static to make the client and repos variables static, so they can be reused across the code.
